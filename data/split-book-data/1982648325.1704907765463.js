window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The story of a truly galactic civilization with more than 6,000 inhabited worlds.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand</i> is a science-fiction masterpiece, an essay on the inexplicability of sexual attractiveness, and an examination of interstellar politics among far-flung worlds. First published in 1984, the novel's central issues - technology, globalization, gender, sexuality, and multiculturalism - have only become more pressing with the passage of time.&nbsp;</p> <p>The novel's topic is information itself: What are the repercussions, once it has been made public, that two individuals have been found to be each other's perfect erotic object out to \"point nine-nine-nine and several nines percent more\"? What will it do to the individuals involved, to the city they inhabit, to their geosector, to their entire world society, especially when one is an illiterate worker, the sole survivor of a world destroyed by \"cultural fugue\", and the other is - you!</p>";
