window.bookSummaryJSON = "A vicious 15-year-old \"droog\" is the central character of this 1963 classic. In Anthony Burgess' nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal, invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. <p><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom.
