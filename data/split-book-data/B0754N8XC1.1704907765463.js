window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Benedict Cumberbatch reads Franz Kafka's famous story of man-turned-insect, </b><b><i>Metamorphosis</i></b>.</p> <p><b>Winner of </b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b><b> Earphones Award Â© </b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b></p> <p>After a night of troubled dreams, Gregor Samsa wakes to discover that he has turned into a huge, monstrous, cockroach-like creature, with an armour-plated back and multiple limbs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gradually, he comes to terms with his new state - but his parents and sister are horrified and increasingly revolted. To them, Gregor is unclean, verminous and entirely repellent, and as he becomes more and more of a burden, their horror turns to a terrible indifference....&nbsp;</p> <p>First published in 1915, Kafka's surreal existential novella explores concepts such as the absurdity of life, alienation and the disconnect between mind and body. Read by Benedict Cumberbatch (<i>Sherlock</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>The Imitation Game</i>), this tale - often described as one of the greatest in the history of fiction - is chilling, captivating and darkly comic.&nbsp;</p>";
