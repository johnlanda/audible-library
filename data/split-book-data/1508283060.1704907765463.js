window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of </b><b><i>Star Wars: Resistance Reborn</i></b><b> comes the “engrossing and vibrant” (Tochi Onyebuchi, author of </b><b><i>Riot Baby</i></b><b>) first book in the Between Earth and Sky trilogy inspired by the civilizations of the Pre-Columbian Americas and woven into a tale of celestial prophecies, political intrigue, and forbidden magic.</b></p> <p><i>A god will return</i><br> <i>When the earth and sky converge</i><br> <i>Under the black sun</i></p> <p>In the holy city of Tova, the winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial even proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man’s mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain.</p> <p>Crafted with unforgettable characters, Rebecca Roanhorse has created a “brilliant world that shows the full panoply of human grace and depravity” (Ken Liu, award-winning author of <i>The Grace of Kings</i>). This epic adventure explores the decadence of power amidst the weight of history and the struggle of individuals swimming against the confines of society and their broken pasts in this “absolutely tremendous” (S.A. Chakraborty, nationally best-selling author of <i>The City of Brass</i>) and most original series debut of the decade.</p>";
