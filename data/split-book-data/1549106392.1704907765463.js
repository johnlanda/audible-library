window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Arthur C. Clarke award-winning author of </b><b><i>Children of Time</i></b><b> brings us an extraordinary space opera about humanity on the brink of extinction, and how one man's discovery will save or destroy us all.</b></p> <p><i>The war is over. Its heroes forgotten. Until one chance discovery....</i></p> <p>Idris has neither aged nor slept since they remade him in the war. And one of humanity's heroes now scrapes by on a freelance salvage vessel, to avoid the attention of greater powers.</p> <p>After Earth was destroyed, mankind created a fighting elite to save their species, enhanced humans such as Idris. In the silence of space they could communicate, mind-to-mind, with the enemy. Then their alien aggressors, the Architects, simply disappeared - and Idris and his kind became obsolete.</p> <p>Now, 50 years later, Idris and his crew have discovered something strange abandoned in space. It's clearly the work of the Architects - but are they returning? And if so, why? Hunted by gangsters, cults and governments, Idris and his crew race across the galaxy hunting for answers. For they now possess something of incalculable value, that many would kill to obtain.</p>";
