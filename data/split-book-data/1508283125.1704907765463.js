The sun is held within the smothering grip of the Crow God’s eclipse, but a comet that marks the death of a ruler and heralds the rise of a new order is imminent.<br> <br> The Meridian: a land where magic has been codified and the worship of gods suppressed. How do you live when legends come to life, and the faith you had is rewarded?<br> <br> As sea captain Xiala is swept up in the chaos and currents of change, she finds an unexpected ally in the former Priest of Knives. For the Clan of Matriarchs of Tova, tense alliances form as far-flung enemies gather and the war in the heavens is reflected upon the earth.<br> <br> And for Serapio and Naranpa, both now living avatars, the struggle for free will and personhood in the face of destiny rages. How will Serapio stay human when he is steeped in prophecy and surrounded by those who desire only his power? Is there a future for Naranpa in a transformed Tova without her total destruction?<br> <br> Welcome back to the fantasy series of the decade in <i>Fevered Star</i>—book two of Between Earth and Sky from one of the “Indigenous novelists reshaping North American science fiction, horror, and fantasy” (<i>The New York Times</i>) and the “epic voice of our continent and time” (Ken Liu, award-winning author of <i>The Grace of Kings</i>).</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
